# Codename "Cyprus"

Made for my friends at Cyprus. A quickl DEMO of React Hooks / GraphQL / SSR (yes,
server side rendering).

[LIVE DEMO](http://sergeylukin.insomnia247.nl:5445/)

## Development

```shell
npm i
npm run watch
```

## Production

```shell
npm i
npm run build
npm start
```

## Extra

This is a one-repo barebones working out of the box project. So having few
nodes behind load balancer and having them run any of the commands listed above
(depending on the environment you run them in) is all it takes.

Of course there are other more optimized, performant and secure ways to deploy this app.
But that's top secret information, can't share it here.
